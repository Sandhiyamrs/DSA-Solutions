# 🔢 Move Zeroes – Optimized Approach

## 📝 Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, move all **0's** to the **end** of the array while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

You must do this *in-place* without making a copy of the array.

---

## 🧪 Example
### Input:
nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]

### Output:
[1, 3, 12, 0, 0]

### Explanation:
All zeroes are moved to the end, while non-zero numbers maintain their order.

## ✔️ Constraints
- 1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10⁵  
- Only in-place solutions allowed
