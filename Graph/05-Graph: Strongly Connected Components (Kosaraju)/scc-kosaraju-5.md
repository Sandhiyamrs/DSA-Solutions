# 🔗 Strongly Connected Components (SCC)

## 📝 Problem Statement
Given a directed graph, find all **strongly connected components** using Kosaraju's algorithm.

## 🧪 Example
Input: graph = {0:[1],1:[2],2:[0],3:[2,4],4:[3]}  
Output: [[0,1,2],[3,4]]  

## ✔️ Constraints
- Graph nodes labeled 0 to n-1
